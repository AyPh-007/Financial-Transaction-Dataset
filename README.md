### **Narrative Summary: Credit Card Transactions and Fraud Insights Dashboard**

This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive view of 13 million credit card transactions, offering key insights into transaction behaviors, potential fraud, and systemic errors across different dimensions such as time, geography, card characteristics, and error types.

A total of **211,000 transactions** have been flagged as suspicious or problematic, representing approximately **1.59%** of all activity. These flagged transactions typically involve higher amounts, averaging **\$66.44**, compared to **\$50.34** for normal transactions—suggesting that fraudulent or error-prone transactions tend to be of greater value.

**Geographic patterns** reveal that flagged transactions are predominantly concentrated in the United States, with the highest counts in populous states such as **California, Texas, New York, and Florida**. The interactive tree map and map visualization emphasize this regional clustering, which may point to either higher transaction volumes or regional risk factors. (further analysis)

From a **temporal perspective**, transaction anomalies tend to peak during business hours, particularly between **10 AM and 4 PM**, with a noticeable increase on **Wednesdays and Fridays**. This could reflect patterns in consumer behavior or operational vulnerabilities during peak periods. (further analysis)

Analyzing trends over time, the **yearly comparison from 2010 to 2018** shows consistent transaction volumes, with normal transaction amounts hovering around **\$64 million** per year and flagged amounts remaining significantly lower—typically around **\$1 million** annually.

On the technical side, the most frequent cause of flagged transactions is **“Insufficient Balance”**, accounting for over **131,000 instances**, or **62%** of all flagged records. Other common issues include **bad PIN entries**, **technical glitches**, and invalid card details (such as CVV, expiration date, or ZIP code).

The dashboard also incorporates filters for **card types (Credit, Debit, Prepaid)** and **card brands (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, Amex)**, alongside a multi-year selector to narrow down transactional patterns across different timeframes.

Overall, this dashboard offers valuable intelligence for detecting fraud, improving error handling, and identifying behavioral or operational trends in credit card usage. The inclusion of demographic data (via linked user profiles) and merchant information (via MCC codes) lays the groundwork for deeper segmentation and risk profiling.
